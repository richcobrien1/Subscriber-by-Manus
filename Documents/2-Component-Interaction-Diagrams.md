Component Interaction Diagrams
1. User Authentication Flow
User App → API Gateway → Authentication Service → User Database
     ↑                           ↓
     └───────────────────────────┘
         (JWT Token returned)
User enters credentials in mobile/web app
Request is sent to API Gateway
Authentication Service validates credentials
On success, JWT token is generated and returned
App stores token for subsequent requests
2. Real-time Audio Communication Flow
User A App ←→ Signaling Server ←→ User B App
     ↓                               ↓
     ↓           WebRTC              ↓
     └───────────────────────────────┘
       (Direct P2P audio connection)
User A initiates audio communication
Signaling server exchanges connection information
WebRTC establishes direct peer-to-peer connection
Audio streams directly between users
Signaling server maintains connection status
3. Group Audio Communication Flow
                 ┌─→ User B App
                 │
User A App ←→ Media Server ←─→ User C App
                 │
                 └─→ User D App
All users connect to media server
Media server mixes audio streams
Mixed audio is distributed to all participants
Individual mute controls affect only user's stream
Music sharing is coordinated through media server
4. Location Tracking Flow
User App → Location Service → Location Database
   ↑              ↓
   └──────────────┘
    (Location updates)
User app sends GPS coordinates periodically
Location Service processes and stores data
Service calculates proximity between group members
Updates are pushed to all group members
Proximity alerts are generated when thresholds met
5. Music Sharing Flow
User A App → Media Service → Group Database
     ↓             ↓
     ↓             ↓
User B App ← Notification Service
User A selects music to share
Media Service registers shared content
Notification Service alerts group members
Group members can join the shared music session
Audio synchronization maintained through Media Service

Security Implementation
1. Authentication Security
Multi-factor authentication for account access
JWT tokens with short expiration times
Refresh token rotation for extended sessions
Password hashing using bcrypt with salt
Rate limiting for login attempts
Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
2. Data Encryption
End-to-end encryption for all audio communication
TLS/SSL for all API communications
AES-256 encryption for data at rest
Secure key management using AWS KMS or similar
Perfect Forward Secrecy for communication sessions
3. Location Data Security
Granular permission controls for location sharing
Time-limited location access grants
Fuzzy location option for approximate positioning
Location data purging after session ends
No historical location tracking without explicit consent
4. Network Security
WebRTC with DTLS-SRTP for secure media transport
Signaling server with TLS encryption
API Gateway with WAF protection
DDoS protection through CDN services
Regular security audits and penetration testing
