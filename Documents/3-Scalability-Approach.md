Scalability Approach
1. Horizontal Scaling Strategy
Stateless Services
API services designed as stateless microservices
Containerized with Docker for consistent deployment
Kubernetes for orchestration and auto-scaling
Load balancing through Kubernetes Ingress or dedicated load balancers
Database Scaling
Sharding for user and group data based on group_id
Read replicas for high-read operations
Database connection pooling to manage concurrent connections
Caching layer with Redis to reduce database load
Real-time Communication Scaling
WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer connections to offload server
Media server clusters for larger groups
Regional deployment to reduce latency
SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) architecture for efficient media routing
2. Caching Strategy
Multi-level Caching
Browser/app-level caching for static assets
CDN caching for global content delivery
API response caching with Redis
Database query result caching
Cache Invalidation
Time-based expiration for location data
Event-based invalidation for user profile updates
Versioned cache keys for API responses
Distributed cache synchronization
3. Asynchronous Processing
Message Queues
Kafka or RabbitMQ for event processing
Background workers for non-real-time tasks
Event sourcing for reliable state management
Dead letter queues for failed operations
Batch Processing
Aggregated analytics processing
Scheduled maintenance tasks
Bulk notifications
Historical data archiving
4. Regional Deployment
Multi-region Strategy
Geographically distributed deployment
DNS-based routing to nearest region
Cross-region data replication
Active-active configuration for high availability
Edge Computing
Edge servers for low-latency requirements
Local caching at edge locations
WebRTC TURN servers in multiple regions
CDN integration for static content
