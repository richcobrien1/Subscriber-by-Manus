Group Audio Communication App with Location Tracking - System Architecture
1. Overview
This system architecture outlines a real-time group audio communication application with location tracking capabilities, similar to Polaris 'Ride Command+'. The application allows subscribed users to communicate via audio, share music, and track each other's locations in real-time.
